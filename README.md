## **_What is igtk?_**

Is An  Open Source program for each game designed to manipulate its graphics beyond the limits imposed by the game itself.

All for the benefit of low-resource gamers (no graphics cards or low RAM), so I can assure you that igtk will allow you to run all available games at 60fps.

## **_Igtk It's a miracle?!_**

Yes it's up to you, well it only modifies the files that your own game brings, in this case *Journey.cfg*, igtk doesn't install any additional software, it's just a legitimate editor of real-time game properties. If the specific game does not offer such an opportunity, it will be totally impossible, but not for me! :]
